    <h1> Correlations and Causation </h1>
    <p>Correlation is used to show the relationship between to points on the graph. It shows if the two points contain a positive or negative correlation. It only applies when the variable is linear. </p>
    <h1> Correlation and Causation</h1>
    <p>Correlation shows the relationship between the points and tells us if the points are related positively. Causation refers to how they possibly have caused or been a direct relation to one another. For example when one variable changes, the other changes. </p>
    <h1> Compare and Contrast </h1>
    <p> They used scattered plots to show relationships. With scatter plots we can see where the data is close together and we can gather relationships that way. A parrallel cooridinates plot plots the lines instead of the points. It displays the relationships by the lines being close together like the points in the scatter plot. They also have interactive scatter plots they use to show relationships. These are similar to regular scatter plots except they are interactive and they change when you act with the plot. </p>
